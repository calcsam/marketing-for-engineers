        <span className="font-semibold">Why do engineers distrust marketing?</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Engineers will give you a variety of reasons:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc">
        <li className="group relative hover:text-blue-500 cursor-pointer">
          <b>Shallow and surface-level.</b> Most software marketers haven't used and don't understand the products they pitch.
          <img class="hidden sm:group-hover:block absolute left-[calc(50%+270px)] w-[calc(50vw-320px)] max-w-[300px] top-[calc(-25vw+170px)] mt-5" src="./fellow-kids.jpg" alt="Your image"></img>
        </li>
        <li className="">
          <b>In the wrong tone.</b> Engineers find most marketing communications vague and overenthuasiastic. 
        </li>
        <li className="group relative hover:text-blue-500 cursor-pointer">
          <b>Reduces trust.</b> Engineers are <i>happy</i> to trade their attention, but expect useful information in return. 
          <img class="hidden sm:group-hover:block absolute left-[calc(50%+270px)] w-[calc(50vw-320px)] max-w-[300px] top-[calc(-25vw+190px)] mt-5" src="./duty_calls.png" alt="Your image"></img>
        </li>      
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here's one irony. Engineers' marketing experience turns them skeptical of the whole field. Yet their depth, clarity, and rigor can make them quite talented marketers.       
      </p>
      <p>
        And in a world with lots of mediocre marketing, <span className="font-semibold">being able to market well is actually a superpower</span>. 
      </p>

        <b>Hi, I'm Sam</b>. <a href="https://twitter.com/calcsam">I'm an engineer</a> and founder. Six years ago I cofounded <a href="https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs">@gatsbyjs</a> to turn the open-source project into a company. We grew to a few million dollars in revenue, and sold to our largest competitor, Netlify.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Gatsby matured, I found myself doing more and more things that fell under "marketing."
      </p>
      <p> 
        I wrote customer stories. Ran webinars. Organized the docs. Delivered conference talks. Tweaked lead scoring. Edited launch announcements. Talked to press. Published a book.
      </p>

        If a pianist picks up the sax, are they a jazz band?
      </p>
      <p>
        In a year or two, I'll probably start something new. But until then, I'll be sharing my lessons here, along with other engineers who've ended up as marketing experts.

        You'll probably find this interesting if:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc">
        <li>
          you work at a startup or small company, or with marketing: <b>product engineer</b>, <b>web developer</b>, <b>growth engineer</b>, <b>marketing engineer</b>, <b>DevRel</b>...
        </li>
        <li>
          or if you're thinking of starting a company, or already have: <b>indie hacker</b>, <b>bootstrapper</b>, <b>current or future founder</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          or if you lead eng projects in a large organization and want more visibility/adoption: <b>staff engineer+</b>, <b>eng manager</b>, <b>eng director</b>...
