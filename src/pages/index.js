        <span className="font-semibold">Most engineers distrust marketing.</span> And for good reason. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Most software marketing: 
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc">
        <li className="group relative hover:text-blue-500 cursor-pointer">
          <b>feels unnatural.</b> Sophisticated users can spot marketers who don't understand their product.

        <li className="group relative hover:text-blue-500 cursor-pointer">
          <b>lacks domain knowledge.</b> Engineers will <i>happily</i> trade attention to get (or give) useful information. Or watch interesting flamewars.

        One possibility: if most marketing is mediocre, <span className="font-semibold">being able to market well is actually a superpower</span>, because it's a breath of fresh air to other engineers.

        <b>Hi, I'm Sam</b>. <a href="https://twitter.com/calcsam">I'm an engineer</a> and founder. Six years ago I cofounded <a href="https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs">@gatsbyjs</a> to turn the open-source project into a company. We built a 50-person org, raised venture capital, grew to a few million dollars in revenue, and sold to our largest competitor, Netlify.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Gatsby matured, I found myself doing more and more things that fell under "marketing."
      </p>
      <p> 
        I wrote customer stories. Ran webinars. Organized the docs. Delivered conference talks. Tweaked lead scoring. Edited launch announcements. Talked to press. Published a book.
      </p>

        If a pianist picks up the sax, are they a jazz band?

        In a year or two, I'll probably start something new. But until then, I'll be sharing my lessons here, along with other engineers who've ended up as marketing experts.

        You'll probably find this interesting if:

        </li>
        <li>
          or if you're thinking of starting a company, or already have: <b>indie hacker</b>, <b>bootstrapper</b>, <b>current or future founder</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          or if you lead eng projects in a large organization and want more visibility/adoption: <b>staff engineer+</b>, <b>eng manager</b>, <b>eng director</b>...
