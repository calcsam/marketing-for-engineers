Gresham’s law in economics is that “bad money drives out good.” 

The technical meaning of this term goes back to an era when "money" meant gold and silver coins, and the royal treasury had the exclusive right to mint money, but could also debase the currency if they needed to raise money for wars.

A more modern formulation of this is "the market for lemons", a 1970 economics paper published by George Akerlof showing that if the quality of a good was difficult to measure (he gave the example of used cars). Akerlof went on to win the Nobel Prize for his work. Also to marry Janet Yellen, now the US Treasury Secretary.

Don't fight over well-tread ground.

The average US software engineer's time is worth $200/hr. The time of an underemployed college grad trying their hand at SEO is worth $20 / hr. The time of someone in a content farm in Eastern Europe or India is worth $2/hr. 

So unless you have an incredibly compelling angle (programmatic content generation, say, or a product you created) it's foolish to compete at marketing with any topic that is legible (travel, hotels, flights, clothing, etc).

Stick to topics that aren't legible.
