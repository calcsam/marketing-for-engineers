Most engineers (and many non-engineers too obviously) prefer written Q&A transcriptions to longform video as it's easier to scan for relevant topics and, ~10x faster to scan-read vs watching a full video.

Longform, free-form video/audio interviews are the cheapest/fastest way to create novel content, which is why doing these is a good idea. But longterm text Q&A -- especially in the age of Descript and GPT which make pretty-good transcripts easy can be a great way to consumer.

Things that make longform video/audio interesting:
- compelling host, or great co-host chemistry (NPR's Car Talk)
- very interesting guests (NPR's How I Built That)
